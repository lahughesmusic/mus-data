      Feel free to preview and print whatever strikes your interest. I ask that
      you not share this site with others. It is intended for students taking
      piano lessons from Lea Hughes only. If a piece does strike an interest and
      it seems too difficult, please print it anyway and we can work on
      simplifying it at the next lesson. There is usually a musical work around
      to make the piece fit the student's skill level if the desire is there to
      learn it.
